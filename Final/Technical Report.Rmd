## Project Overview

Our client, Grupo Bimbo, wants to develop a model to accurately forecast inventory demand based on the historical sales data they collect. Grupo Bimbo is a large bakery store chain that has more than 2500 products spanning over one million stores. Their goal is to meet the product demand for their customers while minimizing unsold surplus. Our group is tasked to create a model to accurately forecast inventory demand based on the historical sales data provided. Creating a successful model will give each of the 1 million stores the ability to accurately request the appropriate amount of each bakery product on a weekly basis.

### Description of Data

Grupo Bimbo supplied 9 weeks of historical data that includes store and product ID, sales, returns, and demand by week. 

The target variable is ‘Adjusted Demand’, which will be an integer representing the demand of a product, in units. 



 The model will be evaluated for accuracy using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), which will penalize models that under-predict more than a model that over-predicts.

## Competition vs IRL Dichotomy

In the proposed real-world situation, our model would be deployed to predict demand for Grupo Bimbo's products and we would be able to evaluate how well our predicted demand matched the actual demand for the products based on the number of returns the company observed. 

### The ideal: An A/B experiment to determine actual demand.

A primary limitation of this data set is that demand is approximated by subtracting the supply from the following week's return of inventory. This would naturally allow for an accurate estimate of demand when supply is higher than demand, but would not accurately estimate demand in cases where the product is under-supplied. 

Using RMSLE helps with this in some ways by having a greater cost for under estimated demand than over estimated demand. However, this alone would not guarentee accurate model evaluation with true demand. 

After model implementation, products should be intentionally overstocked if the product's demand is evaluated by data with no returns.
