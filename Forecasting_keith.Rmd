Create time series for each product and client. 

```{r}
load("products.Rdata")
load("clients.Rdata")
  
# Test with a sample - switch to numeric for filter 
train2$product <- as.numeric(train2$product)
train2$client <- as.numeric(train2$client)
pcs <- train2 %>%
  filter(product < 300, client < 1000)

# Group data by product/client/week and then take the median for those values (includes multiple depots)
pcs1 <- pcs %>%
  group_by(product, client, week) %>%
  summarise(p_c_w = median(demand)) %>% 
  mutate(p_c = median(p_c_w))
  



# Spread out the data to columns (shows all weeks of data, missing is NA)
pcs2 <- spread(pcs1, week, p_c_w)

# Put back into rows
pcs2 <- gather(pcs2, "week", "demand", 4:8)

# Set NAs to a constant (tried 0, and 1)
pcs2$demand[is.na(pcs2$demand)] <- pcs2$p_c




```

Linear model for each product/client

```{r linear model, echo=TRUE}
pcs2 <- pcs %>% 
  group_by(product, client) %>%
  do(linearmodel = lm(demand ~ week, data = .))

(pcs2$linearmodel[2])

library(broom)

models <- pcs2 %>% tidy(linearmodel)
models
```


Time Series and Arima
```{r}
# Create column of time series
pcs2.ts <- pcs2 %>% 
  group_by(product, client) %>%
  arrange(week) %>%
  do(timeseries = ts(.$demand, start = 3, end = 7, frequency = 1)) 

pcs2.ts
unlist(pcs2.ts$timeseries[5])

# Now I have a time series object for each client/product combination. 

# Below is where I am having trouble

pcs2.ts$arima1 <- lapply(pcs2.ts$timeseries, FUN =
                                             arima, order = c(3,0,0))



pcs2.ts <- pcs2.ts %>%
