## Load Data


```{r}
setwd("/Volumes/Half_Dome/datasets/grupo-bimbo/")

# Using fread function to speed things up with the train.csv file
train <- fread("train.csv", header = TRUE)
train <- tbl_df(train)
test <- fread("test.csv", header = TRUE)
test <- tbl_df(test)

# Using standard read.csv for smaller data sets
clients <- tbl_df(read.csv("cliente_tabla.csv"))
products <- tbl_df(read.csv("producto_tabla.csv"))
town_state <- tbl_df(read.csv("town_state.csv"))



```

## Translate column names into English

```{r Translate Columns}

colnames(train) <- c("week", "depot", "channel", "route", "client", "product", "sales_units", "sales", "returns_units", "returns", "demand")
colnames(test) <- c("id", "week", "depot", "channel", "route", "client", "product")
colnames(clients) <- c("client", "client_name")
colnames(products) <- c("product", "product_name")
colnames(town_state) <- c("depot", "town", "state")

```

## Split training set

```{r Split train into train and validation sets}

train2 <- train %>% filter(week <= 7)

train2 %>% 
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarise(Number = n())

validate <- train %>% filter(week > 7)

validate %>% 
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarise(Number = n())


```

## Save data

```{r}
# Save as R dataframes, which take up less space than csv files
# These files will be loaded into other scripts instead of the csv files

system.time(save(train, file = "train.Rdata"))
# Test feather
system.time(write_feather(train, "train.feather"))
# only takes 1/3rd the time 

save(train2, file = "train2.Rdata")
save(validate, file = "validate.Rdata")
save(test, file = "test.Rdata")
save(clients, file = "clients.Rdata")
save(products, file = "products.Rdata")
save(town_state, file = "town_state.Rdata")


# Also saving as csv file for input into Microsoft Azure ML and other tools
# write.csv(train2, file = "train2.csv")
# 

```
