# Persistant Baseline Model

This model assumes that the previous week's demand will persist to the following two weeks. If a product or store id is not found in the training data, then the model will predict that the demand will be the average demand

```{r}

ave_product_demand <- train2 %>%
  group_by(product) %>%
  summarise(ave_demand = mean(demand))
ave_product_demand

```



```{r RMSLE}


```
